# PhotoSwitchProject

### Objective of the project: Construct a ML model for in order to predict Transition wavelengths of photoswitch molecules

### Measures of succes:
1. Achieve good performance on the prediction tasks by leveraging external data
2. Implement Graph-based methods that can account for solvent effects on the transition wavelength vai a FiLM mechanism or incorporating extra features
3. Constructing a model where prediction error is interpretable and may be attributed to characteristics of the
molecular representation
